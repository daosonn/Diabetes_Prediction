Model: Diabetes Prediction
The deep learning model is built to predict the risk of diabetes based on input factors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and other indicators. Accurate predictions can assist in early diagnosis and management of diabetes.

The problem is set up using data from a CSV file, which includes health parameters related to diabetes, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. A multi-layer neural network model is constructed from these parameters. After training, the model will display loss and accuracy values and plot two graphs to illustrate the learning process of the model: one graph for loss and one for accuracy.

To run the file, please download the dataset from GitHub to your computer, upload the file to your software, and execute the code to read the data and train the model.
